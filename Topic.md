#Hobbies

## ***I have one main hobby and it is work because I am a workaholic probably because I don't set priorities and never plan ahead***

# Me actually at work!!!

### I love being part of a team and just helping and teaching people of all ages. I have some bad habits which is interrupting people and not letting people finish their sentences, but other than that I spend most of my time at work. Also I love to talk about work when I am not at work. Yes, I am a pretty boring guy.

  Snacks are life
 
  *My life basically revolves around snacks. You will never not catch me without a snack. Snacks are life. Anything with sugar is considered a snack.*
